# frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map

### What is this?

This a project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree. It is a neighborhood map. I listed my favorite places in Tokyo, Japan. You can try this live demo [Travel Tips: Tokyo!](https://iamzhaihy.github.io/udacity-fend-google-map/) 



### What did I use?

I am still learning, so the tools I used are basic (also effective) ones:
- Javascript
- JQuery
- KnockoutJS
- Wikipedia API
- Google Maps API





### How to run it?

All you need is to do is:

1. Uncompress the zip file
2. Locate the *index.html* file
3. Right click and open it with your favorite browser.
   (Or you can just drag it to a running browser)

### Notice

1. All the things you need is in the compressed file. If the file was damaged or corrupted, you can find a copy on my Github.
2. I will add more features to this map after I learn more about using framework and APIs.
